"""b701_record.py -- THE ACT'S RECORD TOOL, b701 under (R311).

### b698's record tool is IMPORTED (tools/b698_record.py, sealed at b698 and unedited) with its act names rebound to b701 -- its worklist
### module K, ACT and PREV, and EVERY import-time constant b699's traps named (SESSION, SUBAGENTS, the previous act's window, FACE, the mirror
### names, ROOT_EXCLUDE, _standins) rebound here explicitly; b700's repaired _defect_short (the act PASSED AT THE CALL) carried by copy and
### rebound over b698's; b700's own late routes (capture over continuation sessions, reads, commands) carried here with b701's names and not
### imported, so that no b700 module rebinds b698's names after this tool's. The research routes -- the correspondence reading, the dispatch,
### the runner, the prints and the grade -- are b698's and b689's, carried by copy with b701's names (the runner's bank text names the act).
### Every python child is started as `python -X utf8`.
### Written by the Write tool at b701 in stages: stage one, step zero's routes; Components 2-5 by the Edit tool.
### Routes: `python tools/b701_record.py <route> [dry]`. After the seal this tool's own print is how the entry, the dry entry and the trail
### are read (data/b690_rules.txt row (1)); no commit is amended at any point (data/b692_rules.txt row (1)).
