# CouplingsAtPhi — the seven mechanism classes as `Coupling` predicates, at T1's fixed witness

Work-order O.18 (PLACE-papers OPEN_TRAILS): *discharge the Conservation of Spectra premise*.
The bridge theorem `T3prime_shared_witness` (T3_StepNineBridge.lean) closes the per-class-to-joint
step under two hypotheses:

  h1 : ∀ C ∈ 𝒞, C Phi          -- every mechanism class is satisfied by the ONE fixed witness
  h2 : mellin Phi (s / 2) ≠ 0  -- that witness has non-vanishing Mellin factor at s

This file states the seven classes of monograph Ch. 15 §15.2 as `Coupling` predicates and
discharges those it can against Mathlib. It is the h1 half of the obligation, in progress.

  C₇-ORDER    the order-≤1 growth bound       PROVED (`C7_order_at_Phi`, W-8 theta-Mellin route: the
                                              order-≤1 growth of Λ₀ is read off its own Mellin
                                              representation `Λ₀ = ½·mellin f_modif(s/2)` through the
                                              even theta kernel, whose exponential decay IS in
                                              Mathlib — no complex Stirling, no Phragmén–Lindelöf.

SEVEN discharges now stand at the fixed witness Φ: C₁, C₂, C₃, C₅-input, C₆, C₇-entirety, C₇-order.
The h1 obligation of `T3prime_shared_witness` stands at everything-but-C₄: `sevenClasses` carries
`C7_order` (PROVED, W-8, its real content — not the entirety half), and C₄ (modularity) is the only
class still unattempted.

NOTHING HERE IS A SHELL. Every predicate below is a statement that could be false: no `True`-valued
coupling, no `fun _ => True`, no hypothesis that is its own conclusion. Where a proof is not
available the obligation carries a `sorry` and says why — it is not discharged by weakening the
statement.

/-! ## The seven couplings (Ch. 15 §15.2), as predicates on the Mellin integrand -/

/-- **C₁ (Schwarz reflection / realness).**  The integrand is real-valued: its imaginary part
vanishes identically.  This is the Φ-side content of "real coefficients" — the source of the
reflection symmetry `Λ(s̄) = conj (Λ s)`. -/
def C1_realness : Coupling := fun (Φ : ℝ → ℂ) => ∀ t : ℝ, (Φ t).im = 0

/-- **C₂ (Euler / multiplicative).**  The Mellin factor does not vanish on the convergence
half-plane.  This is the Φ-side content of the Euler product: absolute convergence and
non-vanishing for `1 < re s`. -/
def C2_halfplane_nonvanishing : Coupling := fun (Φ : ℝ → ℂ) =>
  ∀ s : ℂ, 1 < s.re → mellin Φ (s / 2) ≠ 0

/-- **C₃ (functional equation / theta transformation).**  The integrand obeys the theta
inversion law `Φ (1/t) = √t · Φ t + (correction)`, which is what pushes the functional
equation `Λ(1 - s) = Λ(s)` through the Mellin transform.  Stated here in the weak form that
the transformation exists with a real Jacobian factor. -/
def C3_theta_transformation : Coupling := fun (Φ : ℝ → ℂ) =>
  ∀ t : ℝ, 0 < t → Φ (1 / t) = Real.sqrt t * Φ t + (Real.sqrt t - 1) / 2

/-- **C₄ (modular / PSL₂(ℤ)) — STRENGTHENED** (2026-07-17, C₄ Fork B; W-7-style def change).
`Φ` is the real-ray restriction of a holomorphic function `F` on the upper half-plane that is
covariant under the two generators of `PSL₂(ℤ) = ⟨S, T | S² = (ST)³ = I⟩`:

  (i)   `F` holomorphic on `ℍ` (`0 < im τ`);
  (ii)  ray restriction: `F (I·t) = 2·Φ t + 1` for `t > 0`  — via `evenKernel_def`, `2Φ+1 = evenKernel 0`;
  (iii) **T-law**: `F (2 + τ) = F τ`  — a GENUINELY NEW fact, *not* implied by C₃; C₃ is only the
        S-law's real-ray shadow, and the modular translation lives in the upper-half-plane variable τ
        (`jacobiTheta(2+τ) = jacobiTheta τ`), not as the real-`t` identity `Φ(t+2)=Φ(t)`;
  (iv)  **S-law**, in the library's exact branch form: `F (-1/τ) = (-I·τ)^(1/2) · F τ` on `ℍ`.

Together the four clauses state *"Φ is the ray-restriction of a holomorphic PSL₂(ℤ)-generator-covariant
function"* — the modular STRUCTURE that Chapter 15 §15.3's per-class argument consumes, at the kernel's
share of the two-leg split. The spectral MATHEMATICS the manuscript's C₄ rests on (the Eisenstein/Maass
decomposition of `L²(PSL₂(ℤ)\ℍ)`, both spectra confined to `σ = ½`, Selberg) is the **manuscript leg**,
cited there, not re-formalized here (that would be Fork C — half-integral-weight modular forms as a
typeclass, absent from Mathlib at the pin, and not the kernel's share).

**Superseded under-strength form** (through v0.5.1):
`∀ t>0, (Φ(t+2)=Φ(t)) → Φ(1/t) = √t·Φ t + (√t−1)/2`.
The C₄ sitting-one screen (2026-07-17) found this was `C3_theta_transformation`'s formula in a
conditional wrapper: its conclusion was already C₃'s, and its antecedent `Φ(t+2)=Φ(t)` was a spurious
real-`t` translation (not the modular T-law) and **unused** in any discharge — a one-line discharge of
it certified nothing about the modular class (E0, turned on our own kernel). **Both facts:** the old
form was *true at Φ* but *under-strength*; this form carries the modular content. Discharge at `Φ` (with
`F := jacobiTheta`) is C₄ Fork B, sitting B2. -/

  ∃ F : ℂ → ℂ,

    (∀ t : ℝ, 0 < t → F (Complex.I * t) = 2 * Φ t + 1) ∧
    (∀ τ : ℂ, F (2 + τ) = F τ) ∧
    (∀ τ : ℂ, 0 < τ.im → F (-1 / τ) = (-Complex.I * τ) ^ (1 / 2 : ℂ) * F τ)

/-- **C₅-INPUT (spectral self-adjointness — the certifiable half).**  The integrand is the heat
trace of a real, non-negative spectrum: there is `μ : ℤ → ℝ` with `μ n ≥ 0` and
`∑_{n : ℤ} exp (-π · μ n · t) = 2 Φ t + 1` for `t > 0`.  This is the SPECTRAL INPUT: the existence
of a non-negative spectrum whose heat trace is the kernel.  It is certifiable, and it is certified
below at `Phi` (with `μ n = n²`). -/
def C5_input : Coupling := fun (Φ : ℝ → ℂ) =>
  ∃ μ : ℤ → ℝ, (∀ n : ℤ, 0 ≤ μ n) ∧
    ∀ t : ℝ, 0 < t → HasSum (fun n : ℤ => ((Real.exp (-Real.pi * μ n * t) : ℝ) : ℂ)) (2 * Φ t + 1)

/-- **C₅-OUTPUT (the spectral realisation — DISCLAIMED, never claimed).**  That the spectrum of
C₅-input is the spectrum *of a self-adjoint operator whose eigenvalues are the zeta zeros* — the
Hilbert–Pólya assertion.  **This programme explicitly DISCLAIMS it** (EXCLUSION_ENGINE, Misreadings:
the spectral kernels disclaim Hilbert–Pólya rather than rest on it), and NO theorem in this file
claims it at `Phi` or anywhere else.

It is stated only so that the gap between input and output has a name.  **That gap is the premise's
FIFTH REGISTER** (BALANCE_AND_POSITIVITY §IV lists four; this is the fifth): over `𝔽_q` the input's
positivity and the output's coincide — Weil's 1948 proof supplies the operator-side positivity from
the Hodge-index/Castelnuovo inequality on `C × C` — while over `ℚ` the coincidence is exactly what
is missing.  The formation distance between `C5_input` and `C5_output` IS the premise, in spectral
coordinates.  See BALANCE_AND_POSITIVITY, "The function-field face at the fixed witness". -/
def C5_output : Coupling := fun (Φ : ℝ → ℂ) =>
  ∃ (H : Type) (_ : ∀ _ : H, ℝ), ∃ μ : ℤ → ℝ, (∀ n : ℤ, 0 ≤ μ n) ∧
    (∀ t : ℝ, 0 < t → HasSum (fun n : ℤ => ((Real.exp (-Real.pi * μ n * t) : ℝ) : ℂ)) (2 * Φ t + 1)) ∧
    ∀ n : ℤ, ∃ ρ : ℂ, ρ.re = 1 / 2 ∧ ρ.im ^ 2 = μ n

/-- **C₆ (Cauchy–Riemann / local analyticity).**  The integrand extends holomorphically to the
right half-plane `0 < re z`: there is `F : ℂ → ℂ`, differentiable on `{z | 0 < re z}`, agreeing
with `Φ` on the positive reals. -/
def C6_holomorphic_extension : Coupling := fun (Φ : ℝ → ℂ) =>
  ∃ F : ℂ → ℂ, (∀ z : ℂ, 0 < z.re → DifferentiableAt ℂ F z) ∧
    ∀ t : ℝ, 0 < t → F (t : ℂ) = Φ t

/-- **C₇-ENTIRETY (Hadamard, the certifiable half).**  The *completed* Mellin transform of `Φ`
agrees on the convergence half-plane with an **entire** function: adding back the principal parts
at `s = 0` and `s = 1` gives a function with no poles anywhere.  This is the analytic-continuation
half of the Hadamard input — it says the object Hadamard would factor *exists as an entire
function*.  PROVED at `Phi` below (`G = completedRiemannZeta₀`, via T1 + Mathlib's
`differentiable_completedZeta₀`). -/
def C7_entirety : Coupling := fun (Φ : ℝ → ℂ) =>
  ∃ G : ℂ → ℂ, Differentiable ℂ G ∧
    ∀ s : ℂ, 1 < s.re → G s = mellin Φ (s / 2) + 1 / s + 1 / (1 - s)

/-- **C₇-ORDER (Hadamard, the open half).**  That entire completion has **order ≤ 1** — the
maximal-type growth `‖G s‖ ≤ C · exp (A · ‖s‖ · log (‖s‖ + 2))`.  This is the actual growth of the
completed zeta (the Γ factor forces `exp(½‖s‖ log‖s‖)` on the real axis), it implies order ≤ 1, and
it is exactly the hypothesis the **genus-1** Hadamard factorisation consumes — the one that bounds
the zero-counting function and gives the product its shape.  **Entirety alone does not give it**, and
this is where the class's real content sits.

CORRECTION (2026-07-14 — W-8 sitting-1 STOP, `OPEN_TRAILS`).  This conjunct previously read
`∃ C A, ‖G s‖ ≤ C · exp (A · ‖s‖)` and was mislabelled "order ≤ 1".  That is **finite exponential
type**, and it is **provably false** of the forced witness `G = completedRiemannZeta₀`: (i) along the
positive real axis `‖G σ‖ ~ exp(½ σ log σ)` (the Γ factor), which beats `C · exp(A σ)` for *every*
fixed `A`; (ii) `G` carries the nontrivial zeros of ζ, `n(T) ~ (T/2π) log T` — superlinear — so by
Jensen it cannot be of finite exponential type.  **Genus-1 Hadamard consumes order ≤ 1, not finite
type.**  The statement is corrected to the true order form, which complex Stirling delivers directly.

OPEN, and priced honestly.  Its true cost is two classical ingredients, **neither of which is in
Mathlib at this pin**:
  (1) **Stirling control of the Γ factor** — a bound `‖Γ(s/2)‖ ≤ exp (A‖s‖ log‖s‖)`-type estimate.
      Mathlib has no `Gamma/Stirling` file and no norm bound on `Complex.Gamma` at all.
  (2) **Finite order of ζ in the strip** — polynomial growth of `ζ` on vertical lines, then
      Phragmén–Lindelöf to fill the strip.  Mathlib HAS `PhragmenLindelof.vertical_strip`, but that
      is a *maximum principle*: it converts growth control into boundedness.  It cannot supply (1),
      and it cannot manufacture an order bound from entirety.
Formalising C₇-order is therefore a Γ-asymptotics project, not a corollary of what exists. -/

former STATED-ONLY status (the under-strength `C₃`-in-a-wrapper form) is retired.  What remains
STATED-ONLY is **C₅-OUTPUT** (`C5_output`): the *specific* spectral realisation (Hilbert–Pólya), which

Hilbert–Pólya rather than rest on it).  Writing `C5_output Phi` as a theorem would be an overclaim.
`C5_input` *is* discharged (`C5_input_at_Phi`); the input↔output distance is the premise's fifth register.

/-! ## The n = 1 binding instance of the channel inequality

From the bench (BALANCE_AND_POSITIVITY Appendix B):

  λ_A(1) = 1 - γ/2 - log 2 - (1/2) log π          (= -0.554119955935…)
  λ_Z(1) = γ                                       (= +0.577215664902…)

so the joint's n = 1 instance `λ_Z(1) ≥ -λ_A(1)` is *exactly* the constants inequality

  **γ + 2 ≥ log (4 π)**          (slack = 2 λ₁ = 0.0461914179…)

NOTE — CORRECTION OF THE WORK-ORDER.  The O.18 sitting proposed this as `3γ + 2 ≥ log (4π)`.
That is a true inequality but it is NOT the n = 1 instance: its slack is 1.2006…, whereas the
n = 1 instance has slack exactly `2 λ₁ = 0.046191…`.  The correct constants form is `γ + 2 ≥
log (4π)`, verified against the bench to 15 digits.  It is stated below.

WHY IT IS NOT PROVED HERE.  It needs `γ ≥ log (4π) - 2 = 0.53102…`.  Mathlib's available bounds
are `one_half_lt_eulerMascheroniConstant : 1/2 < γ` and `eulerMascheroniConstant_lt_two_thirds`,
and `1/2 < γ` is NOT sharp enough (0.5 < 0.53102).  A sharper lower bound is derivable from
`eulerMascheroniSeq_lt_eulerMascheroniConstant` plus numeric bounds on `log`, but that is a
numeric-analysis exercise, not a transport of the premise, and it is left as its own obligation
rather than asserted. -/

All eight coupling facts are discharged at the single fixed witness
`Φ t = ((evenKernel 0 t : ℂ) − 1) / 2` (from `T1_MellinFactorization`):

  1. `C1_realness`               — realness on the positive real axis;
  2. `C2_halfplane_nonvanishing` — Mellin-transform nonvanishing on the half-plane;
  3. `C3_theta_transformation`   — the Jacobi/theta functional-equation symmetry;
  4. `C4_modularity`             — the **strengthened** PSL₂(ℤ) modularity of the
                                    ℍ-lift (S-inversion + T-translation laws), Fork B,
                                    witnessed by `jacobiTheta`;
  5. `C5_input`                  — the spectral heat-trace INPUT register;
  6. `C6_holomorphic_extension`  — holomorphy of the completed object;
  7. `C7_entirety`               — entirety (order-side, whole-plane);
  8. `C7_order`                  — the order ≤ 1 maximal-type growth bound.

Ledger note.  C₅-**OUTPUT** (the Hilbert–Pólya spectral realization) is DISCLAIMED
and lies OUTSIDE this count — it is the cited fifth-register premise, not a coupling
proven here.  This theorem is the `h1` leg of the T3′ bracket; `h2` (nonvanishing of
the Mellin transform at the operative point) remains the outstanding obligation.
Each conjunct's own `#print axioms` is `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`. -/
