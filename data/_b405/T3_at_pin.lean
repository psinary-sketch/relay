# T3 — the step-(9) bridge (per-class exclusion ⟹ all-combinations exclusion)

The load-bearing target of the LV-Conservation programme.  Formalization
plan (per work order):

1. Define "coupling contributes only through `Φ`".
2. Prove that the zero set of `s ↦ mellin Φ (s / 2)` is a function of
   `Φ` (T3a) — trivial via T1, elevated to a named theorem.
3. Show that a *joint* witness `Φ` satisfying every coupling and having
   `mellin Φ (s / 2) ≠ 0` at `s` immediately gives combined exclusion
   (T3b) — trivial existential extraction.
4. Attempt the main bridge (T3_main): per-class exclusion at `s`
   ⟹ combined exclusion at `s`.

The manuscript argument is: zero locations are spectral (s-side) data;
inter-class couplings contribute only to `Φ` (s-independent side); hence
combinations of classes cannot produce s-side effects no single class
produces.

At the level of quantifiers this asks
`(∀ C ∈ 𝒞, ∃ Φ, C Φ ∧ mellin Φ (s/2) ≠ 0) → ∃ Φ, (∀ C ∈ 𝒞, C Φ) ∧ …`.
The move from `∀∃` to `∃∀` is not free without a witness-selection or
cofinality assumption on the class family in `Φ`-space.  This is exactly
the **emergent-totality question** flagged in FINDINGS F.2026-07-09-b.
Per work-order T3 rules, we STOP at this step with one pinned `sorry`
and no weakened statement.

/-- **T3 main — step-(9) bridge.**  Per-class exclusion at `s`
⟹ combined exclusion at `s`.

Manuscript reading: because the couplings contribute only to `Φ` and
`s` enters only through the kernel `t ^ (s / 2 - 1)` in `mellin Φ`,
combinations of couplings cannot manufacture an s-side effect (a forced
zero at `s`) that no single coupling can.

Formal reading: the hypothesis is
`∀ C ∈ 𝒞, ∃ Φ_C, C Φ_C ∧ mellin Φ_C (s / 2) ≠ 0`,
and the conclusion asks for a *single* `Φ` witnessing every `C ∈ 𝒞`
simultaneously with `mellin Φ (s / 2) ≠ 0`.  This is a `∀∃ ⟹ ∃∀`
commutation that has no free witness — the emergent-totality gap of

/-- **T3′ — the bridge closes under Determination's shared witness.**
If the programme's Determination condition is in force, every coupling
in `𝒞` is satisfied by the *same* `Φ` — namely T1's fixed `Phi` — and
that `Phi` has non-vanishing Mellin factor at `s / 2`.  The `∀∃ ⟹ ∃∀`
gap of T3 collapses trivially: the shared witness `Phi` is both the
existential witness for every per-class formulation and the joint
witness for the combined formulation.

This is not a weakening of T3; the hypotheses `h1, h2` name the extra
information that Determination supplies.  The proof is
`⟨Phi, h1, h2⟩` — no bookkeeping, no swap. -/

/-- **T3″ — countermodel: the *unrestricted* bridge fails.**  Without
Determination's shared witness, the general `∀∃ ⟹ ∃∀` implication over
`(𝒞, s)` is false.  Witnessed at `s = 3` by two integrands that agree on
`Ioi 0` (so both have the same non-vanishing Mellin factor there, namely
`completedRiemannZeta 3 ≠ 0`) but disagree at `t = -1` (so no `Φ` can
satisfy both `Φ = f₁` and `Φ = f₂` simultaneously).

Consequence: Determination is doing real work in T3′ — the bridge would
be unprovable without it. -/
