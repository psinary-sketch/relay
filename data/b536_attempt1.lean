THIS PROGRAMME'S WORK (act b536, ruling (R146)(1)-(2)) -- NOT VENDORED. SPIRAL_MAP section 7 rule 9 applies here in full:
`theorem`, never `lemma`.

THE SEAM, FROM MATHLIB'S FUNCTIONAL EQUATION. A zero of zeta with real part at most 0 is a trivial zero
(`zeta_zero_re_nonpos`): for s = 1 - z, Mathlib's `riemannZeta_one_sub` writes zeta(z) as
2 (2 pi)^(-s) Gamma(s) cos(pi s / 2) zeta(s); for Re s >= 1 every factor but the cosine is nonzero
(`Complex.cpow_ne_zero_iff`, `Complex.Gamma_ne_zero`, `riemannZeta_ne_zero_of_one_le_re`), so cos(pi s / 2) = 0,
s is an odd integer (`Complex.cos_eq_zero_iff`) and z = 1 - s an even integer at most 0, not 0 (`riemannZeta_zero`).
With it the seam `rh_strip_imp_rh` of PowerWindow.lean holds, RHChain's `h2_sign_imp_rh` and H2Bridge's `h2_sign_imp_ch`
are inhabited, and `h2_sign ↔ RiemannHypothesis` and `conservationHypothesis ↔ h2_sign` hold with no hypothesis.
Nothing here proves RH or h2_sign: these are equivalences between open statements.
